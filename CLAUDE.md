# Project To Text - VS Code Extension

## Overview

This VS Code extension converts open workspace projects into formatted text files, similar to GitIngest but with the following key features:

1. Works with any open folder in VS Code
2. Allows selective file/folder inclusion with full content
3. Non-selected files show only preview (first few lines) with truncation indicator
4. Always includes complete directory structure
5. Copies output directly to clipboard

## Usage

Extension can be activated via:
- Command palette
- Keyboard shortcut
- Command line (if parameters needed)

### Input Options

When activated, users have two options:

1. **GUI Selection** (NEW):
   - Multi-select interface with checkboxes
   - Shows all files and folders in the workspace
   - Uses icons to distinguish files (📄) from folders (📁)
   - Search/filter capability built-in
   - Space to select, Enter to confirm

2. **Text Input** (Original):
   - Comma-separated format: `README.md, package.json, src/`
   - If no input provided, includes all files fully

### Output Format

```
Directory structure:
└── project-root/
    ├── file1.js
    ├── file2.js
    └── src/
        └── index.js

Files Content:

================================================
FILE: file1.js (fully included)
================================================
[full content here]

================================================
FILE: file2.js (preview only)
================================================
// First few lines of code
const example = true;
...
[FILE TRUNCATED - showing 5 of 150 lines]
```

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Replace "Hello World" command with "Project To Text"
2. ✅ Implement file/folder selection dialog or command input
3. ✅ Create directory tree builder
4. ✅ Implement file content processor (full vs preview)
5. ✅ Format output and copy to clipboard
6. ✅ Add GUI selection mode with multi-select QuickPick
7. ⏳ Add configuration for preview line count
